A simple alarm app that can ring on timed schedules or other event, such as battery full-charging! This is a project I developed for a Mobile Programming course mid-term project at my campus. It is still experimental, though, especially the event-based alarm.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
1. Java
2. Gradle
3. Android SDK
4. Or just install Android Studio should work fine.

### Steps
1. Clone this project to local.
2. Open the project with an IDE (I use Android Studio for its many many development tools).
3. Build (and sync the Gradle) and run on an Android phone/tablet or an AVD.
